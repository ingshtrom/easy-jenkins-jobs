The _logentries_ module does not depend on any non-core modules. You also need a [logentries.com] account - [see getting started with logentries.com](https://logentries.com/docs/configure/#section9).\n\nIf you are looking for [winston](https://github.com/indexzero/winston) integration, please see [winston-logentries](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/winston-logentries).\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install logentries\n\n## Usage\n\n    var logentries = require('logentries');\n\n    var log = logentries.logger({\n      token: 'YOUR_TOKEN'\n    });\n\n    // level specific methods like 'info', 'debug', etc.\n    log.info(\"I'm a Lumberjack and I'm OK\");\n\n    // generic log method, also accepts JSON entries\n    log.log(\"debug\", {sleep:\"all night\", work:\"all day\"});\n\n## Key Features\n\n* simple API\n* fully configurable\n* also an EventEmitter\n* fully tested\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module sends your logging entries to the [logentries.com] service. You will need an account with this service for the module to work.\n\nOnce you have [logentries.com] account, you need just one configuration item to initialize a logging instance (you can create more than one):\n\n* TOKEN: As supplied by Logentries when you create a logfile of source type Token TCP.\n\nThe module provides you with a set of logging methods that correspond to the standard syslog log levels. These are, in order of increasing severity:\n\n* debug\n* info\n* notice\n* warning\n* err\n* crit\n* alert\n* emerg\n\nYou can change these levels using the _levels_ configuration option (see below).\n\nEach level has a convenience method named after it, so you can say _logger.debug(...)_ or _logger.info(...)_, for example. There is also a general logging method, _log_, that takes the name of the log level as the first entry.\n\nTo create a logging instance, call the _logger_ function of the module, passing any options as the first argument:\n\n    var mylogger = require('logentries').logger({\n      levels: {\n        chill:0, meh:1, hmm:2, notgood:3, ohnoes:4, omgwtfbbq:5\n      }\n    })\n\nEach logger object is an instance of [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter). You can listen for the following events:\n\n* _log_: capture each log event (maybe for your own archive)\n* _error_: get notification of any errors in the logging system itself\n\n## Conventions\n\nThe standard syslog log levels are used by default: `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `err`, `crit`, `alert`, `emerg`.\n\n## API\n\nFor the API examples, assume the following lines of code at the top of your source code file:\n\n    var logentries = require('logentries')\n\n    var log = logentries.logger({\n      token: 'YOUR_TOKEN'\n    });\n\nThis gives you a standard _log_ object.\n\nYou should really also read the [logentries.com] documentation so that you understand how [logentries.com] works: [logentries.com User Guide](https://logentries.com/docs/userguide)\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nWhen you create a _log_ object with the _logger_ function on the module, you can supply the following options:\n\n* _token_: required; logentries destination token uuid\n* _secure_: optional; default is false; use tls for communication\n* _transport_: optional; default is LogEntriesTransport; transport object\n* _levels_: optional; default is syslog-style; custom log levels\n* _printerror_: optional; default is true; print errors to STDERR with console.error\n* _timestamp_: optional; default is true; autogenerate a timestamp\n* _usequotes_: optional; default is false; add double quotes around every field\n\nThe _token_  entry relates to your [logentries.com] configuration. The _transport_ option allows you to provide an alternative transport implementation (see below).\n\nBy default the module will print errors to STDOUT to aid with debugging in a development context. To run this off, set the _printerror_ option to false.\n\nThe levels option lets you specify custom log levels. You provide these as a object, the property names of which are the log levels. The value of each log level should be an integer specifying its order. For example:\n\n    { lowest:0, lower:1, middle:2, higher:3, highest:4 }\n\n### `<loglevel>`: `log.<logelevel>( entry )`\n\n* _entry_: (required) log entry, can be string or JSON object\n\nSubmit a log entry. The entry data will be submitted to [logentries.com]. If a logging connection to [logentries.com] is not open,\na connection will be opened, and any pending entries will be processed in order.\n\n    log.info('buttered scones for tea')\n\nThe log level and an optional timestamp are prefixed (in that order) to the log entry, and will be present in the [logentries.com] console.\n\nThe `loglevel` convenience methods are dynamically constructed from the configured list of logging levels, a method being constructed for each level, having the name of the level. If you're naughty and use log levels like `log` and `level`, they will be ignored.\n\n### log: `log.log(level,entry)`\n\n* _level_: (required) the name of the log level (must match one of the configured levels)\n* _entry_: (required) log entry, can be string or JSON object\n\nSubmit a log entry, passing the name of the level programmatically. The dynamically constructed convenience methods,\nsuch as _debug_, delegate to this method internally.\n\n    log.log('debug','press wild flowers')\n\nA log entry will only be submitted if the log level is greater than or equal to the current log level setting of the logger. This allows you to drop noisy debugging logs from production environments.\n\n### on: `log.on(event,callback)`\n\n* _event_: (required) one of _error_ or _log_\n* _callback_: (required) callback function\n\nThis method is provided by the standard Node _EventEmitter_. Register callback functions to get notified of errors. The module cannot log errors itself, as it has nowhere to log them! Hosted environments may not provide writable disk access. Therefore, the module simply emits an error event that you can listen for. The module does also print errors to STDOUT by default, to help with debugging. Use the _printerror_ configuration setting to control this (see above).\n\n    log.on('error',function(err){\n       console.log('hangs around.... In bars!? '+err )\n    }\n\nYou may also need to gain access to the verbatim log lines. You can listen to the _log_ event to do this:\n\n    log.on('log', function(logline) {\n       console.log(logline);\n    });\n\nThis gives you the logline, a single string in the format:\n\n    \"level\" \"ISODate\" \"entry\"\n\n### level: `log.level(name)`\n\n* _name_: (required) the name of the level\n\nSet the current log level. All log entries below this level will be ignored. All log levels are given an integer rank when they\nare specified. The default rankings are:\n\n    {\n      debug: 0,\n      info: 1,\n      notice: 2,\n      warning: 3,\n      err: 4,\n      crit: 5,\n      alert: 6,\n      emerg: 7,\n   }\n\nFor example, if you specify a level of _warning_, then log entries at levels _debug_, _info_, and _notice_ will be dropped.\n\n    log.level('warning')\n\n### end: `log.end()`\n\nThis module maintains an open HTTP connection to _api.logentries.com_, so that logging will be fast and efficient.\nIf the connection breaks, it is automatically reestablished.\n\nIf you need to close the connection, call the end method. This primarily useful for unit testing to exit the test process.\nNOTE: if you submit further log entries after calling end, the connection will be reopened.\n\nIf you need finer grained control, then you will need to write your own transport object, or extend the existing one. See the _lib/logentries.js_ file.\n\n## Transports\n\nThis module uses a transport object to perform the actual transfer of data to [logentries.com]. You provide your own customized transport object by using the _transport_ configuration option.\n\nIf you are implementing your own transport object, you need to provide these interface methods:\n\n* _queue( queue )_ : gives you an array to use as a queue, _Array.shift_ items off\n* _consume()_ : process outstanding items in the queue by sending them to [logentries.com]\n* _end()_ : (optional) close connection to [logentries.com]\n\nTake a look at the unit tests (in _test_ folder) to see some simple implementations.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe unit tests use [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), and are in the _test_ folder.\n\n    npm test\n\nThe acceptance tests (these push actual data to the live [logentries.com] service) are simple node scripts, and are in the _accept_ folder.\nCopy the _accept/conf.js_ file to _accept/conf.mine.js_ and add the token for your log file. Run directly:\n\n    node live.accept.js\n\n## logentries.com service\n\nCompany site: [logentries.com]\n\n[logentries.com]: http://logentries.com\n\n",
